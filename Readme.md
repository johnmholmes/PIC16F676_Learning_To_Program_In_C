# This is going to be a series of tutorials for learning to program PIC16F676 in C.

This will start of withthe simple blink program and will move along with more examples. I will be using MPLAB X IDE v5.5 and XC8 to compile the codes.

I will up load the codes that i use which will be the mainc file you can then copy and paste them into your mainc files.

These codes have been tested and written for the PIC16F676 only.

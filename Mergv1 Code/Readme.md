The blink code is one of the first code people learning to program micro controllers or Raspberry PI tend to learn. So I have also started with this demonstration on here. This example is not the only way this could be done. However I have tried to keep it as simple as I can. The PIC I am using has many inputs and output pins. I will be programming on PORTD this has 8 I/O pins Labelled D0 - D7.

The explanation of the code is after the full code below. I would also suggest that you try to change some of the code to change the led flashing and also the delay time.

Once you are comfortable with the code then you can move onto the next version Blink V2.
